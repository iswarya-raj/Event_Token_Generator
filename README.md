# Event_Token_Generator

## 📌 Overview
The **Event Token Generator System** is a secure authentication mechanism designed to generate unique, time-sensitive tokens for event-based access. It ensures only authorized users can participate in an event by providing event-specific tokens that expire after a set duration.

## 🔥 Features
- **Unique Token Generation** – Generates distinct, non-reusable tokens for each event/session.
- **Time-Based Expiry** – Ensures tokens remain valid only for a specific duration.
- **User Authentication** – Links each token to a user ID for secure access control.
- **Multi-Platform Usage** – Works for both physical and virtual event authentication.
- **Event Logging & Tracking** – Maintains records of token usage for audit purposes.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Frontend:** React.js / HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT 

## 🚀 Installation & Setup
